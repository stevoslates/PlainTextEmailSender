# PlainTextEmailSender
PlaintText email sender in python using SMTP. This works with gmail, but could be changed accordingly based on the desired email servers port, and therefore altering the code accordingly.
This could be altered to send HMTL but most mail servers will deny the HTML for secuirty reasons so I just kept it PlainText




Note: You need to change your settings for this to work: you need to allow less secure apps so the connection can be made.
